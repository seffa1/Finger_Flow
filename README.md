# The game
Control two columns which through big rocks into the air. Throw the rocks up as pillars come flying at you. Each time a rock gets over a pillar, you get a point. Keep going for as long as possible before you rock explodes into a delicious particle simulation. Also, the sound is ASMR so bring headphones.

# Required Imports
pygame, random, sys, math

# Startup
Simply run "main.py", put those headphones on, and relax to the sound of exploded rocks.
